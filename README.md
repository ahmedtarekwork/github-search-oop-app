# Github Search

This app I made with vanilla javascript to search in github user profiles, typescript was important for type safe in this project and use OOP features that doesn't exists in vanilla javascript, I used github RESTful API to get user profiles data and there repos and fetch them with pagination technique, each repo has single page to show it's info and files, files can be opend in external page from same app with text highlighting.

## Upcoming features

- render README.md file for each repo
- make personal profile page for each user
- add authentication with github
- show more info about each repo inside repo page
